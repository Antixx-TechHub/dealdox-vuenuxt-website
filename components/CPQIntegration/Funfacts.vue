                        <p>DealDox's product incorporates any CRM and ERP, which offers project and resource management
                            alongside cost tracking, project billing and revenue forecast. Automated quoting tool
                            integration accepts customers' projects and delivers quote and deal transitions to the PSA
                            platform.</p>
                        <p>The current integration transfers the details from the DealDox quotation or SOW into ERP to
                            build the customer contract and project details. After the deal closes, the purpose is to widen
                            the content of this process to provide an end-to-end, quote-to-cash cycle that is functional
                            across a wide range of service industries</p>
