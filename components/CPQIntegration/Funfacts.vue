                        <h3>How does DealDox CPQ Integration work? </h3>
                        <p>DealDox incorporates any CRM and ERP, which offers project and resource management alongside cost tracking, project billing and revenue forecast. CPQ CRM integration accepts customers' projects and delivers quote and deal transitions to the ERP platform.                             
                        </p>
                        <p>The quoting and order management CPQ tool transfers the details from the DealDox quotation or SOW into ERP to build the customer contract and project details. After the deal closes, the purpose is to widen the content of this process to provide an end-to-end, quote-to-cash cycle that is functional across a wide range of industries. 
                        </p>
                        <p> By integrating CPQ DealDox removes barriers between CRM & ERP so that you can convert opportunities into cash. The speed of deal closures is increased by the collaborative data flow between DealDox and your other applications.
                        </p>
